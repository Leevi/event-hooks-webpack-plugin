# Examples
This directory includes basic examples on how you could use the `event-hooks-webpack-plugin`. You can run these examples yourself by cloning the repository, navigating to one of the example directories and running the `webpack` command from there.

```shell
$ cd <path-to-repository>/examples/<example>
$ ../../node_modules/.bin/webpack
```
